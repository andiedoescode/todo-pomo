# Todo for Pomo

An clean todo list app built for my own pomodoro sessions. Meant for use as short todo lists for each work cycle, with tasks populated through local storage. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. They can also filter their list by active, completed, or all tasks, as well as delete all completed tasks. There is a counter at the bottom to indicate how many active tasks remain.
